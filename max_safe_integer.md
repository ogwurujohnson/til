The `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` constant represents the maximum safe integer in JavaScript (2^53 - 1).

The `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` constant has a value of `9007199254740991` (9,007,199,254,740,991 or ~9 quadrillion). 
The reasoning behind that number is that JavaScript uses double-precision floating-point format numbers as specified in `IEEE 754` and can only safely represent numbers between `-(2^53 - 1) and 2^53 - 1`.


Safe in this context refers to the ability to represent integers exactly and to correctly compare them. For example, `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER + 1 === Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER + 2` will evaluate to true, which is mathematically incorrect.

> currently this isn't supported by old browsers, but to add a polyfill for old browsers, you could do this

```javascript
if (!Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) {
    Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER = 9007199254740991; // Math.pow(2, 53) - 1;
}
